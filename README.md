# Hello, world

My name is Jordan Eddy, and I was late to the party. I am an elderly millenial software developer by way of business school, the Army, a stint in the logistics industry, and a tour of duty at a local Java bootcamp. 

To make up for lost time, I have dedicated myself to constantly learning both on and off the job to become a more well-rounded developer while not playing guitar (trying to, anyway...) or nerding out over cars. If there's two things you need to know about me, it's that there is no pupper I will not pat, no nap I will not take, and that I sometimes fall victim to ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exceptions for the sake of a good dad joke. (See what I did there? Classic.)
