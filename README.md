# Hello, world
I am a total newbie trying to self-teach my way into a new career field. 
I have forayed into HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery via Codecademy/FreeCodeCamp courses and am
looking into participating in a code bootcamp in the coming year.
Please visit my personal page at jordaneddy.me to learn more about me.
