# Hello, world
I am a total newb trying to find my way into a new career field. 
I have forayed into HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery via Codecademy/FreeCodeCamp courses as well as Angular 1.X and NodeJS via Udemy. I will be attending a bootcamp for JAVA/SQL in April 2017 with the goal of learning enough to land a junior software dev position.
